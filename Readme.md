##Palate
Palate is the project 2 of the web developer program. The main idea behind developing this application is to help people find their favorite dishes.

###Current features:
The following are the things that the user can do with the application currently:

1. User can register to the application.
2. Edit his profile and upload his profile image.
3. Search for a recipe that he/she wants to plan for the cook.
4. The search displays results from API call to food API's and web scraping some of the web recipes.
5. User can book mark the recipes through the chrome extension.
6. User can also bookmark and add the recipe which he searches from the database.

###Nice to have:
The following are the nice to have features that will be implemented shortly:

1. Option for the user to bookmark the recipe coming from API (Currently it can be viewed but not bookmarked).
2. Including the videos to cooking recipes.
3. Including the grocery list to give out the weekly notifications on the groceries needed.
